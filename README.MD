### Project Vision:
This project Is aimed towards colleges/universities or any other overnight school. 
This project is trying to solve the problem of the lack of information that is provided by the universities and the program they use. 
This project will help students get a better understanding of where they choose to live down to the room level.

### Project outcome goals: 
By the end of their experience with our project the user should be able to make a clear and concise decision on where they want to live.
The user should be able to see building floor plans on a level basis. The user should be able to pick a room inside their desired dorm. 
The user will be able to choose different roommates based on a survey or a search function. 
There will be an administrator end of this project where an admin can switch information manually for a student. 
Any info will be able to be changed except sensitive information. The admin will also be able to add students to the database so they can select rooms.
